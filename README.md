### Alexander Rigler (He/Him or They/Them)

I'm currently learning backend programming in Python with HyperionDev.

I'm looking to get into Rust projects where possible to fill out my systems programming skillset.

Ask me about Linux if you want an in-depth discussion on the virtues of Free Software and the relative efficiency of Linux desktop environments.
